Stitch'd is a work in progress game of mine for the PlayStation Portable. It is an old-fashioned 2D platformer game, nothing that special about it.

In Stitch'd you play as a demented little stitched up guy (I don't even know what to call him) with a scythe. I intend to implement the ability to create levels and even customize your character.

Currently this project is on pause while I study up on C++ and learn more about what I can do for the game.
